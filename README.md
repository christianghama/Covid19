# Covid19
In this project, I perform some data analyses over the public Covid19 repository published by Google at https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/covid19-open-data.

The repository contains country-level datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19 globally. It includes data relating to demographics, economy, epidemiology, geography, health, hospitalizations, mobility, government response, and weather.

For this analysis I used exclusively the **Google Cloud BigQuery** tool as an exercise to explore its main capabilities.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, before rapidly spreading globally, challenging societies, economies, and healthcare systems worldwide. As of the latest data, the virus has infected millions of people and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives across the globe, having profound socio-economic implications, disrupting industries, prompting widespread lockdowns, and exacerbating existing inequalities. Understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic is paramount for informing public health measures, mitigating its impact on society and the economy, and ultimately charting a path toward recovery and resilience.

## Methodology
This project consists of a series of analysis over the Covid19 repository to have insights that helps to understand the various caracteristics of the pandemic. To perform this analysis I used the following techniques and resources:
* SQL statements
* BigQuery visualization capabilities
