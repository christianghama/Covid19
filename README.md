# Covid19
In this project, I perform some data analyses over the public Covid19 repository published by Google using Google Cloud Big Query.

The repository, which is available at https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/covid19-open-data, contains country-level datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19 globally. It includes data relating to demographics, economy, epidemiology, geography, health, hospitalizations, mobility, government response, and weather.
